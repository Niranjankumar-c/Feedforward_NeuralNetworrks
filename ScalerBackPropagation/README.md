The entire code present in the jupyter notebook has divided into following sections,
- Use generated data and classes from before
- Code the back propagation algorithm for our first FF network - single weight and all weights
- Visualize working of our first FF network
- Code the back propagation algorithm for a larger FF network
- Understand the iterative kernel within the back propagation algorithm
- Exercises
