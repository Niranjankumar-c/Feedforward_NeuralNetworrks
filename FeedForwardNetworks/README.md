In this project contains the code to implement the feedforward neural network from scratch in python. We will analyze how neural network will handle the non-linear data when compared with single sigmoid function. 

The entire code present in the jupyter notebook has divided into following sections,
1. Generate data that is not linearly separable
2. Train with Sigmoid Neuron and see performance
3. Write from scratch our first feedforward network
4. Train the FF network on the data and compare with Sigmoid Neuron
5. Write a generic class for a FF network
6. Train generic class on binary classification
7. Train a FF network for multi-class data using a cross-entropy loss function
8. Excercises
